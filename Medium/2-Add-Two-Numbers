'''given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, 
with digits stored in reverse order, and your task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list in reverse order.

# Brute force solution

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        result = []
        carry = 0
        i = 0

        # Loop through both lists until both are exhausted and there's no carry left
        while i < len(l1) or i < len(l2) or carry:
            val1 = l1[i] if i < len(l1) else 0
            val2 = l2[i] if i < len(l2) else 0

            # Calculate the sum of corresponding digits and carry
            total = val1 + val2 + carry
            carry = total // 10
            result.append(total % 10)

            i += 1

        return result
