## Purpose of this repo
To showcase my approach and thought processes behind solving various LeetCode tasks. Where applicable, for most challenges Iâ€™ve included a brute-force solution followed by an optimised version, with improved time and space complexity. However I found that a few tasks were simple enough to only require one approach.
